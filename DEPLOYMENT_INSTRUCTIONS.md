## üöÇ **Railway Deployment Steps**

### 1. **Connect GitHub Repository**
```bash
# Railway will auto-detect your repository
# Go to https://railway.app and click "New Project"
# Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
# Choose: tapcoman/HookLineStudio
```

### 2. **Add PostgreSQL Database**
```bash
# In Railway dashboard:
# Click "New" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"
# This will automatically set DATABASE_URL
```

### 3. **Set Environment Variables**
```bash
# Required Environment Variables in Railway:

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Firebase Configuration  
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_firebase_private_key_with_newlines
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_firebase_client_email

# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key

# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
CLIENT_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

### 4. **Configure Custom Domains (Optional)**
```bash
# In Railway dashboard:
# Go to Settings ‚Üí Domains
# Add your custom domain and configure DNS
```

### 5. **Deploy**
```bash
# Railway will automatically:
# 1. Build your application (npm run build:railway)
# 2. Run database migrations (npm run migrate)
# 3. Start the server (npm run start:railway)
# 4. Health check endpoints will confirm deployment
```

## üîß **Post-Deployment Configuration**

### **Stripe Webhook Setup**
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`
4. Copy webhook secret to Railway environment variables

### **Firebase Domain Configuration**
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Settings
2. Add your Railway domain to authorized domains
3. Update OAuth redirect URIs if using social login

### **Health Check Verification**
```bash
# Verify deployment health:
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected",
  "services": {
    "openai": "configured",
    "stripe": "configured", 
    "firebase": "configured"
  }
}
```

## üéõÔ∏è **Monitoring & Maintenance**

### **Railway Dashboard Monitoring**
- Application logs with structured JSON output
- Health check status on `/health` endpoint
- Memory and CPU usage metrics
- Database connection monitoring

### **Database Monitoring**
```sql
-- Query performance monitoring (run in Railway PostgreSQL):
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY total_time DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### **Application Monitoring**
- Health endpoints: `/health`, `/ready`, `/live`
- Structured logging for error tracking
- Request/response time monitoring
- Memory usage alerts

## üîÑ **Scaling Recommendations**

### **Immediate Scale (0-1000 users)**
- Current Railway setup handles this perfectly
- Monitor database connection usage
- Consider Redis caching for session data

### **Medium Scale (1000-10000 users)**
- Add read replicas for database
- Implement Redis for session management
- Consider CDN for static assets

### **Large Scale (10000+ users)**
- Microservices architecture
- Separate AI generation service
- Load balancing and auto-scaling

## üÜò **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues**

**Build Failures:**
```bash
# Check build logs in Railway dashboard
# Verify all environment variables are set
# Run locally: npm run build:railway
```

**Database Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL is set automatically
# Check connection in Railway PostgreSQL dashboard
# Run migration manually: npm run migrate
```

**Authentication Problems:**
```bash
# Verify Firebase configuration variables
# Check Firebase authorized domains
# Ensure FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY has proper newlines
```

**Stripe Integration Issues:**
```bash
# Verify webhook endpoint URL
# Check webhook secret matches environment variable
# Test webhook with Stripe CLI
```
