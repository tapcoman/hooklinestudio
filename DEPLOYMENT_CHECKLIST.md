## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Backup current production database
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Confirm latest code is pushed to main branch
- [ ] Alert team of deployment window

### 2. Environment Variables Verification
Ensure these are set in Railway dashboard:
```bash
# Core Application
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000

# Firebase Authentication
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account-email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----..."

# OpenAI Integration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Stripe Payments
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_or_test_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret

# Database (Auto-configured by Railway)
DATABASE_URL=(automatically set by Railway PostgreSQL)
```

### 3. Deployment Process
1. **Push to Production**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor Railway Build**
   - Watch build logs in Railway dashboard
   - Verify build completes without errors
   - Check that migrations run successfully

3. **Verify Health Endpoints**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/live
   ```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

#### Critical User Flows Testing
- [ ] **Landing Page**: Hero loads with all animations
- [ ] **Demo Components**: TriModal rail platform switching works
- [ ] **Video Studio**: Interactive demo functions correctly
- [ ] **Mobile Navigation**: Responsive menu operates properly
- [ ] **Authentication**: Firebase login/registration works
- [ ] **Hook Generation**: Core functionality remains intact
- [ ] **Payment Flow**: Stripe integration functional

#### Performance Validation
- [ ] **Page Load Speed**: First contentful paint < 2s
- [ ] **Mobile Performance**: Responsive on all device sizes
- [ ] **Animation Performance**: Smooth 60fps animations
- [ ] **Bundle Loading**: Progressive loading of components

#### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] **Chrome**: Latest version
- [ ] **Firefox**: Latest version  
- [ ] **Safari**: Latest version
- [ ] **Mobile Safari**: iOS devices
- [ ] **Chrome Mobile**: Android devices

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
If critical issues are detected:

1. **Railway Dashboard Rollback**
   - Go to Railway project > Deployments
   - Click on previous successful deployment
   - Click "Redeploy" button

2. **Verify Rollback Success**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
   ```

### Manual Rollback (5-15 minutes)
If dashboard rollback fails:

1. **Git Revert**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5  # Find last working commit
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Force Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # If schema changes need reverting
   railway run npm run db:migrate:down
   ```

### Emergency Rollback (15-30 minutes)
For severe issues:

1. **Environment Restoration**
   - Restore previous environment variables
   - Revert domain configurations if changed
   - Restore database from backup if needed

2. **Communication**
   - Update status page
   - Notify users of temporary issues
   - Document issue for post-mortem

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Response Time**: < 500ms for API endpoints
- **Error Rate**: < 1% for critical paths
- **Memory Usage**: < 80% of allocated
- **CPU Usage**: < 70% sustained

### Alert Thresholds
- Error rate > 5% (immediate alert)
- Response time > 2s (warning)
- Memory usage > 90% (critical)
- Health check failures (immediate)

## Known Issues & Mitigations

### TypeScript Warnings
- **Status**: Non-blocking compilation warnings exist
- **Impact**: No runtime impact, build completes successfully
- **Mitigation**: Monitor for any new runtime errors
- **Follow-up**: Address type mismatches in next maintenance cycle

### Bundle Size
- **Status**: 466KB main bundle (acceptable for features)
- **Impact**: ~2-3s initial load on 3G networks
- **Mitigation**: Progressive loading already implemented
- **Optimization**: Consider code splitting for future versions

### Asset Optimization
- **Status**: Logo.png is 500KB (could be optimized)
- **Impact**: Slightly slower initial page load
- **Mitigation**: Served through Railway CDN
- **Follow-up**: Optimize logo size in next update

## Success Criteria

### Deployment Considered Successful When:
- [ ] All critical user flows function correctly
- [ ] No increase in error rates from previous version
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Mobile experience functions properly
- [ ] New UI components render correctly across browsers
- [ ] Authentication and payment flows work seamlessly

### Sign-Off Required From:
